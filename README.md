# Java Concepts: equals() and hashcode() methods
Simple implementations of equals() and hashcode() methods
## What
The repo contains the following: 
- examples of above methods
- overriding equals() method
- overriding hashcode() method
## Why
I added this to GitHub purely for reference purposes as these concepts can get blurry after a period of absence from Java. ;)
## Who
Since the code is not elaborately commented, the concepts might not be easy to grasp for the beginners without studying them beforehand.  
For those who have used these methods before but might have forgotten the details: 
- the examples here are working implementations
- it is probably faster than e.g. googling for the concept
## Usage
Feel free to use the codes as you like. Share if someone needs it.
